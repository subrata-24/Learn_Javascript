<!-- 
📌 What is this code about?
This HTML+JavaScript code demonstrates **closures in JavaScript**, particularly 
how a function can retain access to its lexical environment even after the outer 
function has finished executing.

📘 What topic does it cover?
- Closures in JavaScript
- Event handling (`onclick`)
- DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById`, `document.body.style.backgroundColor`)
- Functional programming (returning functions)

⚙️ What is the working of the code?
- A function `clickHandler(color)` is defined that returns another function 
(a closure) which changes the page's background color.
- When a button is clicked, it triggers the returned inner function, which updates 
the `backgroundColor` using the `color` that was "closed over".

🧠 How does it work?
- `clickHandler("orange")` returns a function that remembers `color = "orange"`, and
 assigns it to the `onclick` event of the "orange" button.
- Same for `"green"`.
- This works due to **closure** — the returned function retains access to `color` 
even after `clickHandler` has completed execution.

📗 Important concepts:
🔹 **Closure**: A function that remembers the variables from its enclosing scope 
even when called outside that scope.
🔹 **Lexical Scope**: Scope determined by the physical placement of code in the 
source file.
🔹 **DOM Manipulation**: Changing the document structure or style dynamically using 
JavaScript.

📢 Common pitfalls:
- Not returning the function inside `clickHandler()` would result in the color 
changing immediately when assigning handlers.
- Forgetting to use closures may lead to unexpected behavior when using loops or 
delayed callbacks.

    // This function demonstrates closure:
    // It accepts a color and returns a function that remembers this color value.
    // When the returned function is called (via button click), it changes the body's background color.
    function clickHandler(color) {
        // This inner function has access to the `color` variable even after `clickHandler` has finished execution.
        return function () {
            // When this function is executed, it changes the background color using the remembered `color`
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = `${color}`;
        }
    }

    // Assigning the returned functions to the `onclick` event of buttons
    // These will NOT execute immediately because we are passing a reference to a function
    // Due to closures, each function remembers the color passed during creation
    document.getElementById('orange').onclick = clickHandler("orange");
    document.getElementById('green').onclick = clickHandler("green");

    // 👇 Here's what happens:
    // clickHandler("orange") → returns a function → assigned to button's onclick
    // Later, when button is clicked, that returned function runs and sets the color
