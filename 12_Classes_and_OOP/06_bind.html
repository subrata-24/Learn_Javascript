<!-- 
What is bind?
→ `bind()` is a method in JavaScript used to fix the value of `this` inside a function.

What it does?
→ It creates a new function where `this` is permanently bound to a specific object 
(e.g., a class instance).

How it does?
→ It returns a new version of the function with `this` locked to the object you pass.

Necessity of it:
→ In event listeners (like button clicks), `this` normally refers to the DOM element. 
  But if we want to access class properties from inside the method, we must use `bind()` to keep `this` pointing to the class object.

Workflow of it:
1. Class method `handleClick()` is passed to an event listener.
2. But when the event happens, `this` would normally refer to the button (DOM).
3. So we use `.bind(this)` to fix `this` to the React class instance.
4. Now inside `handleClick()`, `this.server` correctly refers to class property, 
not the button.

            Why use `.bind(this)` here?
            - `this.handleClick` is a class method.
            - When used directly in `addEventListener`, it loses its original `this` 
            context.
            - So we "bind" the method to the current object (`this` = instance of React 
            class).
            - Without `.bind(this)`, `this.server` would be `undefined` inside 
            `handleClick`.
